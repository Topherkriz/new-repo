          Ranking in number 4 who is last but not least, it is the 2000 STI
          Impreza. At this point a collectors item, with a price ticket that can
          buy a small home. The 2000 STI Impreza is the <em>ONLY</em> STI that
          is in the coupe version. Of course the smaller chassis with almost the
          same power as the rest, this Impreza kicked started the industry to
          its course today.

          Coming in at number <em>1</em> it is the 2002 <em>Bugeye</em> STI. A
          thing to note about this STI is that just like its older STI sibling
          this was only offered in japan. It's weird funky headlights with giant
          fog lights gave it it's name for that. I always enjoyed this chassis
          because it was the starting point for the "<em>Lego</em>parts that
          became interchangable. Although you can drop a EJ207 on all of these
          chassis' this generation is the one I would love to have with that
          engine.

          Spot number 2 goes to yours truly the 2004 <em>Blobeye</em>
          <strong>STI</strong>. The thing about this car is that it was the car
          that brought most of not <em>ALL</em> JDM kids to want this car. All
          the car games had at least this version of the STI, I know I did I
          would always go for it. Even though I could not afford it when it
          forst came out new I was still an early teenager. Of course theres
          always am opportunity to get a something like this, yes, thats right I
          was able to get my hands on this generation STI. Even though I rated
          it second, I choose it because it came with all the STI goodies that I
          did want to spend later on more money. This was the next best thing.

        <h2 class="card-title">2007 STI</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Running in 3rd the next Impreza is the <em>Hawkeye</em> STI this
          generation was said to be the "<em>bulletproof</em> USDM version of
          the EJ family. Compared to it;s older siblings, the 2007 STI has the
          best gearing ratios and best interior options at the time. Many people
          take the front end of the Hawkeye and end up having their older gen
          STI look more newer. Not my most favorite but not the least favorite.
